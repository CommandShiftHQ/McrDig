# Reddit Clone

You'll be making a basic Reddit clone using AJAX combined with vanilla JS (no libraries/frameworks). The project will follow a component structure similar to that enforced by popular JS libraries such as [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

This is a tough walkthrough and there are challenges you'll need to complete on your own (though you can pair if you wish to do so), so **please read carefully (including any linked content), and don't copy and paste**.
