# Challenge: Displaying Posts

This one is on you. We've gone through how to retrieve posts from the API using `DataSource.prototype.get`, and how to render an array of post objects to the DOM using `DOM.prototype.render()` and the `Posts` component. 

Remove any sandbox code from your `index.html`. Your challenge is to combine the two: Fetch the posts data from the API, and render the data using the `Posts` component to make a live posts listing page.

If you are unsure on anything then you should revisit earlier steps before asking a tutor.

Feel free to exercise your new found HTML and CSS knowledge also!
