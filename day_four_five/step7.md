# Displaying Comments

Again, how you solve this step is up to you.

The challenge is to, on the individual post page, retrieve from the API a list of comments associated with the post, and render these underneath the post.

The API endpoint for retrieving comments is `GET /posts/{post.id}/comments`.

You will also need to create some new components which return the correct html for displaying the comments.

Remember, we only want to display the comments on the `post.html` page, not on the `index.html` page.

There's nothing on this step which you haven't done in the challenge already, so take your time looking back over the work you've done already if you get stuck.
