# Creating comments

In this step we are going to create a form on our individual post page, to add comments to that post.

We do this by making a `POST` request to `/posts/{post.id}/comments`.

The problems we need to solve are:
1. What data do we need to send?
2. How do we collect that data?
3. How to we trigger the http request to create a comment?


## What data do we need to send?

We know from the previous step that comments have the following structure:

```json
{
  "postId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "name": "id labore ex et quam laborum",
  "email": "Eliseo@gardner.biz",
  "body": "laudantium enim quasi est quidem magnam voluptate ipsam eos"
}
```

Lets look at each field in turn:
- `id` - When creating an item, the `id` field is automatically generated by the server. We don't need to generate this.
- `postId` - We already know the post id that we want to add the comment to - it will be sent as part of the request URL
- `name` - needs to be collected from the user
- `email` - needs to be collected from the user
- `body` - needs to be collected from the user

## Collecting the data
To collect the name, email, and body data from the user, we will need to create a form. This should be its own component.

Create a file `components/CommentForm.js` and import it into `post.html`.

In this file, create a component function that returns the html for a form, with the appropriate input fields for collecting a name, email and longer text body, as well as a submit button.

    <label for="body">
      Comment:
      <textarea name="body"></textarea>
    </label>
    <button type="submit" />
  </form>
  ```
